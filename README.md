## Overview

Product preview card component challenge has enabled me to practice my HTML and CSS skills.
This project is not too much challenging but it's educative at its capacity.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

1. That I can center a div using Flexbox.
2. For more responsiveness, you should use relative dimensions like percentages, em and rems.
3. I learnt how to import fonts and icons.
   To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Material+Symbols+Outlined:opsz,wght,FILL,GRAD@20..48,100..700,0..1,-50..200"
/>
```

```css
@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Fraunces:opsz,wght@9..144,700&family=Montserrat:wght@500;700&display=swap");
```

### Continued development

1. Javascript.
